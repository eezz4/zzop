//! `mutating-route-no-auth` — flags a POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE `IoProvide` (an HTTP route) whose handler
//! symbol, walked via call-graph BFS (`zzop_core::callgraph::bfs_reachable` over the whole-repo
//! `SymbolGraph`), never reaches a callee whose NAME looks like an auth guard — unlike the DSL
//! `http/auth-gates` rule (registration-line handler-identifier text only), this follows actual calls.
//!
//! ## Guard vocabulary
//! [`DEFAULT_AUTH_GUARD_PATTERN`] is matched against (name-segment shape below — see "Match granularity")
//! every symbol id `bfs_reachable` visits — a name-vocabulary check, not a body inspector. `access` is
//! guarded to `(has|can|check|require)access` only, since bare `access` also clears on non-auth names like
//! `accessLog`/`dataAccess`. A blanket `require[A-Z]\w*` fragment was considered and rejected: it would
//! clear pure input-validation middleware (`requireBody`/`requireJson`/`requireQuery`) and silently
//! suppress genuine missing-auth findings; for a security rule the recall loss outweighs the
//! false-positive savings, and `requireXxx` helpers with a real auth stem (`requireAuth`, `requireOwner`)
//! still match via those stems. A real guard named outside this vocabulary still false-positives here —
//! the finding message points at config `rules: { "mutating-route-no-auth": "off" }` (embedders:
//! `disabled_rules`) as the escape hatch, since this rule has no inline suppression marker.
//!
//! ## Decidable subset
//! Only mutating-method provides whose `symbol` resolves to a UNIQUE known symbol are checked
//! (`http_scan::resolve_handler`'s "do not guess" contract) — an unresolved or ambiguous handler is
//! skipped. `bfs_reachable` can match the handler's own symbol id at depth 0, so a self-describing handler
//! name alone is enough to clear this check.
//!
//! ## Call-graph language coverage (the OTHER half of the decidable subset)
//! `symbol_graph` is built from re-parsed TypeScript/JavaScript source AND (as of
//! `java21/tree-sitter-java-0.23.5/v2`) re-parsed Java source (`run_callgraph_rules`, which loops
//! `ts_paths`/`java_rels` — see that function's own module doc). No OTHER language parser in this
//! workspace produces the `RawCall` sites `bfs_reachable` walks, so for a handler outside
//! [`CALL_GRAPH_COVERED_EXTENSIONS`], `symbol_graph` restricted to that ecosystem is provably EMPTY — the
//! BFS can never find a guard there. [`is_call_graph_covered`] makes this explicit and load-bearing: a
//! mutating provide outside the covered set is exempt from the BFS entirely, same "do not guess" spirit
//! as the unresolved/ambiguous-handler skip above — recall for an uncovered ecosystem is zero until real
//! coverage exists, honest given the mechanism has no evidence for it, vs. a naming-accident-gated mix of
//! false positives/negatives (skipped only when `resolve_handler` happens to fail on an unrelated name
//! collision) that looks like a bug and is one — exactly what happened before Java's own coverage below.
//! Lifting the exemption for a language needs two additions outside this crate: (1) a `RawCall`-producing
//! extractor (`RawCall`'s own doc, `crates/core/src/callgraph.rs`); (2) engine wiring in
//! `run_callgraph_rules` to gather that language's calls. Java is the first to have done both: its
//! extractor is `zzop_parser_java_21::lang::calls::parse_calls`; its `resolve_file` is an
//! opaque-specifier stand-in, not real package resolution (see `run_callgraph_rules`'s doc for why
//! that's sound here). Neither addition is this crate's call to make (`rules/**` cannot depend on
//! `zzop_parser_typescript`/`zzop_parser_java_21`/engine internals) — see its dependency boundary.
//!
//! ## Precision limit (and its injection completion)
//! This is a vocabulary-based reachability check over the CALL graph only. Route-level middleware —
//! `app.post("/x", requireAuth, handler)`, or a router-level `.use(authMiddleware)` — never appears as a
//! call edge FROM the handler symbol itself, so it is invisible to this rule: a route guarded exclusively
//! via middleware will false-positive. Severity starts at [`Severity::Info`] because of this.
//!
//! Middleware is a per-project environment fact the native call-graph can't see — so, per zzop's design
//! line (native sees the common case; everything else is injected), it is COMPLETED BY INJECTION rather
//! than by ever-growing native middleware modeling. The common Express shapes (`app`/`router.use(guard)`,
//! a route-level guard argument) are the exception that proves the rule: the native TypeScript parser's
//! router-mounts producer (`zzop_parser_typescript::adapters::router_mounts`) now judges and emits the
//! same attribute directly, PREPAID injection for that one common environment, not a second code path —
//! everything outside that vocabulary (a non-Express framework, a project's own custom guard naming)
//! still needs an adapter to inject it. A producer/adapter that understands a project's
//! middleware injects an [`AUTH_GUARDED_ATTR`] attribute on the guarded route (an `IoKey`) or router
//! prefix (a `PathScope`) through the generic entity-attribute channel (`zzop_core::AttributeStore`,
//! [`ScanMutatingRouteNoAuthInput::route_attr_store`]); the native vocab BFS and the injected evidence
//! COMPOSE (either clears the route). This is one consumer of a general channel, not a bespoke auth path.
//!
//! ## Match granularity: tail name PLUS the immediate qualifier
//! [`is_guard_id`] checks TWO trailing segments of a visited id (`<file>#<Receiver>.<method>`), with
//! deliberately DIFFERENT matchers: the tail (method name) keeps the substring
//! [`DEFAULT_AUTH_GUARD_PATTERN`] (verb-shaped names); the qualifier (class name) uses exact
//! camel-token matching against [`qualifier::QUALIFIER_GUARD_TOKENS`] — this is what makes a Java
//! static-utility guard visible (`AuthorizationService.canWriteComment`: `auth` lives only in the
//! qualifier) WITHOUT substring's domain-noun false-clears (`AuthorRepository` ⊃ `auth` — see
//! `qualifier.rs`). A BARE call id's qualifier is its file-extension token — harmless either way.
//!
//! ## Auth-acquisition exemption
//! A provide whose PATH sits on the auth-acquisition surface is exempt entirely, never entering the BFS —
//! that surface IS how a caller gets credentials, so it cannot require pre-existing auth to reach itself.
//! Two tiers, since some acquisition-shaped words also legitimately name unrelated mutating routes (e.g.
//! `POST /devices/register`):
//! - **Standalone tier** ([`AUTH_ACQUISITION_STANDALONE_PATTERN`]): exempt unconditionally — these segments
//!   ARE the auth surface regardless of what else is in the path.
//! - **Conditional tier** ([`AUTH_ACQUISITION_CONDITIONAL_PATTERN`]): exempt only when an auth-family
//!   segment ([`AUTH_FAMILY_PATH_PATTERN`]) also appears in the same path — e.g. `/auth/register` is
//!   exempt, but `/devices/register` is not. Every segment list is matched `/`-delimited on whole path
//!   segments only, never as a bare substring — `/author/profile` does not match `auth`.
//!
//! ## Test-fixture exemption
//! A provide registered in a test/fixture file (`is_test_file` — the same predicate `unreachable`'s
//! dead-island check uses) is skipped outright: a route only defined/invoked from a test isn't exposed
//! application surface.
//!
//! ## NestJS `@UseGuards` decorator exemption
//! A provide extracted by the NestJS adapter whose registration line carries `@UseGuards(...)` coverage
//! (class- or method-level) is exempt from the BFS entirely. NestJS's guard chain runs BEFORE the handler
//! regardless of what the handler's own body calls, so the BFS's core assumption — the guard must be
//! REACHABLE FROM the handler — doesn't apply to decorator-based auth: a decorator application is metadata,
//! not a call edge (the same structural blind spot as route-level middleware, just a different guise of
//! it). The exemption set is a side-channel `HashSet<(file, line)>` — see
//! [`ScanMutatingRouteNoAuthInput::nest_guarded`] — computed independently by
//! `zzop_parser_typescript::extract_controller_guarded_lines` and matched against each provide's own
//! `(file, line)`.
//!
//! **Residual (not fixed here):** NestJS global guards (`app.useGlobalGuards(...)` in `main.ts`, or an
//! `APP_GUARD` provider in a `*.module.ts`) apply to every route in the application, but are a file-level
//! signal that cannot be mapped back to specific routes from the extractor's per-file, per-controller view
//! — see `controller_decorators.rs`'s own module doc for the same residual. A controller relying ENTIRELY
//! on a global guard (no local `@UseGuards`) still false-positives on this rule.
